# arduino_oscilloscope
Something similiar to an oscilloscope, but very cheap. Works on Platform Arduino UNO R3 with max. 2.6 Samples per Second.

Per #define you can toggle between printing Values on Serial Monitor or Serial Plotter. The Serial Plotter reaches up to 2.6 Samples per Second. The Serial Monitor can handle only 600 Samples per Second with Baudrate 230400.

Todo: Add a nice(r) Visualisation or something.
